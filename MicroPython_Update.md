The HiFiveInventor.com link and Technical Information links in this file don't lead anywhere useful.  
The Segger Link has changed and should link to [Segger Link OB](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-ob/) as of 10/16/2025.  
The Segger Link is probably more useful for C programming, so don't worry about it.
